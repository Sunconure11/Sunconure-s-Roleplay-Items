# Sunconure-s-Roleplay-Items
Various items, used for RPing. Will create this to get myself back into coding a bit more, and also for usage in an experiment in trying a civcraft-type server in a modded environment.

Coins: Copper, silver, electrum, gold, iron, and jeweled. Uses metadata. Useless outside of RPing

Foodstuffs: Grilled watermelon. Somewhat useful. Food stuffs from the existing crops added here will be done as well.

Crops: Amaranth, goji berries, devil's claw, echinacea, saffron, coffee, wildberries (red, green, blue, yellow, magenta), valerian, physalis

Loot table shenanigans

Some things drop from leaves in addition to grass, ark style
