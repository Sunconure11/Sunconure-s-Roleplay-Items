# Sunconure-s-Roleplay-Items
Various items, used for RPing. Will create this to get myself back into coding a bit more, and also for usage in an experiment in trying a civcraft-type server in a modded environment.

Coins: Copper, silver, electrum, gold, iron, and jeweled. Uses metadata. Useless outside of RPing

Foodstuffs: Grilled watermelon. Somewhat useful. Food stuffs from the existing crops added here will be done as well.

Crops: Amaranth, goji berries, devil's claw, echinacea, saffron, coffee, wildberries (red, green, blue, yellow, magenta), valerian, physalis

Loot table shenanigans

Some things drop from leaves in addition to grass, ark style

Devil's Claw drops from dead bushes
Goji berries, physalis and wildberries drop from grass
Wildberries have a smaller chance of dropping from leaves
Coffee drops from acacia leaves
Amaranth drops from grass and flowers
Echinacea drops from flowers, as does saffron and valerian
